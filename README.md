In this hands-on project, we will train a Linear Regression model to predict life expectancy. The dataset was initially obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Websites. Data contains features such as year, status, life expectancy, adult mortality, infant deaths, percentage of expenditure, and alcohol consumption.

## Learning Objectives:-
 -Assess the performance of regression models and visualize the performance of the best model using various KPIs.
 
 -Understand the difference between various regression models KPIs such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, R2, and adjusted R2.
 
 -Train and Evaluate linear regression model using Sci-kit Learn library.
 
 -Perform exploratory data analysis and standardize the training and testing data.
 
 -Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform data visualization
 
 -Understand the theory and intuition behind Multiple Linear Regression.
 
 -Understand the distribution and relationship of data
